  * [ ] Hello, world
  * [ ] Discord Chat Bot - Notion
  * [ ] Landing Page
  * [ ] Design a contact form complete with validation, error messages, and confirmation message.

  * [ ] Newsletter signup/cancellation flow
  * [ ] A small site that gathers news from RSS feeds and displays them
  * [ ] Photo gallery
  * [ ] Are you a member of a sports club or do you play in a band? Make a website for that - even if your club doesn't need one
  * [ ] Call up non-profits in your area and ask if they would like to make use of your skills (this is also a great exercise in making cold-calls)
  * [ ] Make a few (insert your preferred CMS) templates
  * [ ] A case study of that time you helped your aunt make a genealogy site
  * [ ] A responsive website navigation (that doesn't default to a hamburger menu) (Why? Because this requires some outside-the-box thinking)

  * [ ] A To-do app you can speak to
  * [ ] An analogue clock
