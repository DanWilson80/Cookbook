2. At the command line type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and you should get a message stating `Serving HTTP 0.0.0.0 Port 8000...`  
3. Locate your `HTML File` and open it into the editor then back to `Project => Running URL and Port` then click on the link for the Server that you created and it will open up the `HTML File` in your browser.
